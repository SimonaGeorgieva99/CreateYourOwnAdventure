            <p>Next stop is the National Gallery for Foreign Arts in Sofia which is the only one of its kind in the Balkans. It is unique with the character of its collection – the art of distant lands, of exotic tribes and nations, of old and new ages coexists with the modern European tendencies. It has a unique collection of Christian sculpture of the Indian province of Goa. Let’s see what other museums are there in the territory of Sofia. <br></p>

                <p>The National history museum features 650 000 objects connected to archeology, fine art and history. The building looks more like a communist palace than a museum as it is a former governmental residence. You can explore a rich collection of stone columns and antique and medieval monuments in the museum’s courtyard. The 500 years of rule by the Ottoman Empire are covered in the first two floors. On the third one, you can see the hall of traditional clothes. <br></p>
