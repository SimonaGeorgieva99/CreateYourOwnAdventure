            <p>The Stambolov Bridge is the beautiful bridge over the Yantra River which brings you to a beautiful viewpoint where you can take a photo of the iconic hillside of Veliko Tarnovo that you can see on every postcard around the city. Built in 1892, the bridge is made of steel and concrete and was one of the first steel bridges to be built in the Balkans. If you follow the bridge, you will reach the Asen’s monument where you can admire even more views of the city. You can then sit down in the nearby café for a Shumensko beer which is made in the city. <br></p>
