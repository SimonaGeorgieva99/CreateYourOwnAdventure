            <p>You are going on a trip to Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria which is the previous capital city of the country. It is the town with the most glorious historical past in Bulgaria and it is a symbol of Bulgarian national pride for every citizen. In English ‘Veliko’ means ‘Great’ and its name comes from its size, beauty and grandeur. Although Sofia became the capital city, Veliko Tarnovo continued to be home of Bulgarian national spirit and self-awareness.  What would you prefer to see first – an outdoor landmark or a museum and some history?<br></p>
