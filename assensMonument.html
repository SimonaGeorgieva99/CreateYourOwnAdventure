            <p>The monument can be seen from almost everywhere in the city. It features the Bulgarian Tsars - Ivan Assen, Theodor-Petar, Kaloyan, and Assen. The statue is a memorial of the tsars for their contributions to the city. Local students occupy the surrounding areas using the scenic setting as inspiration. From the monument you’ll enjoy beautiful views of the old town. You can access the monument on foot via the Stambolov Bridge built over Yantra River. Nowadays it is a pedestrian bridge used by the tourists for taking photos of the city.<br></p>

                <p>Trapezitsa fortress is the second most important one in Veliko Tarnovo. It can be reached from almost every side but the entrance to the hill is at the northern part, which has always offered the easiest access to the hill. The glorious Trapezitsa was probably abandoned intentionally and in an organized matter after the city fell under Ottoman rule. Despite being buried for so long, Trapezitsa stayed in the memories of Bulgarians. So just after the Liberation of 1878 was created a public entity named to discover and excavate historical places like Trapezitsa.<br></p>
