            <p>The first thing you should do and is a must-see is to expore the highlight of the city - Tsarevets Fortress. The fortress is surrounded with 3,000 feet of stone walls. Once past the main gate, it is fairly easy to navigate the fortress on foot. Visitors are free to walk anywhere and climb anything they like. Head to the top of the hill if you want to see the Church of the Ascension. Below the church, on a lower level, you will see Baldwin Tower which name is related to the legend that the Latin emperor Baldwin, captured by the Bulgarian king Kaloyan, was imprisoned and killed by being locked in the tower for so long. There are 5 picnic areas with a refreshment stand where you can enjoy the beautiful view of the town below.<br></p>
