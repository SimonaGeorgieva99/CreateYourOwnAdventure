            <p>The Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God is located on the top of the Tsaravets fortress. It has an extremely unusual religious artwork inside. The outside of the church is very traditional and it is done in Byzantine style with a traditional stone exterior. The interior is incredibly ornate, with floor mosaics of multi-colored marble and gemstones like sapphire. The walls are covered in more traditional Orthodox frescos. <br></p>
