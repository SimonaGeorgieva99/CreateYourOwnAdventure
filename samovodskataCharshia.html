                <p>The Holy Forty Martyrs Temple is one of the most emblematic medieval churches in Veliko Tarnovo. It is located at the foot of Tsarevets Fortress. It was built and its walls were painted in honour of the victory of Tsar Ivan Asen II. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 the temple converted back into a Christian church. Today the Holy Forty Martyrs Temple functions as a museum and is open for visitors, as holy liturgies are served in it on the biggest Christian holidays.<br></p>
