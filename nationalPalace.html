            <p>The National Palace of Culture is the largest multifunctional congress, conference, convention and exhibition center in Southeastern Europe. It is in a hexagon shape and is made of a mass of concrete and glass. Nowadays it is mainly functioning as a concert hall. It also hosts exhibition and trade fairs. In front of it there is a park with plenty of cafes and benches surrounded with a big and large fountain and a lot of green areas. Next to it is located the ‘Lovers bridge’. Its name is given by the citizens because a lot of couples in love enjoy sitting on the bridge and watch the panorama of Vitosha Mountain and the beautiful sunsets.
