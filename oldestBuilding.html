            <p>Your next stop in the city center is St George Rotunda which is located in the heart of ancient Serdica (old name of Sofia). It is a wonder that this building has survived unscathed for such an amount of time. Outside you can see the flagstones of a Roman street and other remnants of Ancient Serdica. Click on the button below to see where is our next stop. <br></p>

                <p>Our next stop is Serdica Amphitheatre which is Sofia’s own Roman amphitheatre. It was one of the largest in the Roman empire, holding gladiator fights and battles of men against wild beasts. Later it became integrated into the design of the Arena di Serdica hotel but visitors off the street can look down at the ruins. <br></p>
